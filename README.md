##  Usage
        BinToHex:         DllToShellCode b <in_file> <out_file>
        Compress File:    DllToShellCode c mode <in_file> <out_file>
        Dll To ShellCode: DllToShellCode d shellcode_mode <param> compress_mode
        Compress File mode
                0 = compress with ntdll
                1 = compress with aplib
        DllToShellCode shellcode_mode
                0 = only call dllmain, <param> is the dllmain param lpReserved
                1 = return export address, <param> is the export name
        DllToShellCode compress_mode
                0 = no compress
                1 = compress with ntdll
                2 = compress with aplib
